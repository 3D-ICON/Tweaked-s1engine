# Tweaked-s1engine
A fully tweaked s1engine

- FPS S1engine
- FPS S1engine (Fixed sounds)
- FPS S1engine (Fixed Orbs)
- FPS S1engine (Fixed Orbs & sounds)
- Pretty S1engine

Place one of them here: TERA\Client\S1Game\Config.

__And make 100% sure they are on read only after replacing your current one.__

_You can make your file read only by right clicking the S1engine file, click on properties and then down below you'll see "Read only".
Tick that on and then apply these changes._

All of 'm are tweaked engines. The FPS engines are highly tweaked ones for maximum FPS. I highly recommend using the "FPS S1Engine". If you use this S1Engine and your class is making different sounds than it's supposed to, use the fixed one.

If you PvE and you do AANM/AAHM, I recommend you to use the Fixed Orbs versions (Otherwise Orbs will be showing the same colour as your debuff.)

You should still see all the mechanics, may you have some issues then let me know.
